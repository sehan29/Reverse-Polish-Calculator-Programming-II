## Overview

The Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator is a tool that uses the postfix method of calculation, commonly used by engineers, scientists, and mathematicians to avoid the use of parentheses and simplify the calculation process. In RPN, every operator follows all of its operands, making it easier to execute calculations on devices with limited keyboard functionality and reducing errors in manual calculation.

##Key Components
#1.Stack Operations: Push, Pop, and maybe Peek.
#2.Parsing the User Input: To handle numbers and operators.
#3.Performing Calculations: Based on parsed input.
#4.Error Handling: For invalid syntax or mathematical errors like division by zero.
#5.View Calculation histroy(Optional)
#6.Creating CLI interface.
