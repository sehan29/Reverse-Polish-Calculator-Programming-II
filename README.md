# Reverse-Polish-Calculator-Programming-II

## Overview

The Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator is a tool that uses the postfix method of calculation. This method is favored by engineers, scientists, and mathematicians because it avoids the use of parentheses and simplifies the calculation process. In RPN, every operator follows all of its operands, making it easier to execute calculations on devices with limited keyboard functionality and reducing errors in manual calculation.

## Key Components

### Stack Operations

The calculator will use a stack to manage numbers and intermediate results. Key operations include:

- **Push**: Add a number to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the top number from the stack.
- **Peek** (Optional): View the top number of the stack without removing it.

### Parsing the User Input

The input string will be parsed to handle numbers and operators, ensuring they are correctly pushed onto the stack or used to perform operations.

### Performing Calculations

Based on the parsed input, the calculator will perform the necessary calculations using the stack. Supported operations include:

- **Addition (`+`)**
- **Subtraction (`-`)**
- **Multiplication (`*`)**
- **Division (`/`)**

### Error Handling

The calculator will handle various errors such as:

- Invalid syntax (e.g., incorrect number of operands for an operator)
- Mathematical errors (e.g., division by zero)

### View Calculation History (Optional)

The calculator can maintain a history of calculations for review.

### Creating CLI Interface

A command-line interface (CLI) will be created to interact with the calculator, allowing users to input expressions and see results.
